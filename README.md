# Payday

- git clone the repository
- Download the data sets and put them in `./data_sets/`
- You should end up with (at least) the following tree:

```
- data_sets/
  |- customers.csv
  |- merchants.csv
  |- terminals.csv
  |- transactions_test.csv
  |- transactions_train.csv
- .gitignore
- paydayHQ.ipynb
- README.md
```

- You gotta do this cause github won't allow files greater than 100MB in the repo :(
- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Run Jupyter Notebook app
- From the Jupyter dashboard, navigate to `path/to/payday` and open `paydayHQ.ipynb`
- If any of y'all have a quicker way to open the project from vs code or whatevs, please let me know
- Before you commit your changes, you might have to clear the cells' outputs, cause the file might be too big to push to Github >:(
- Ughh, maybe this won't be easier... (open to suggestions)

- If you Anaconda installed you can use VS Code with the Jupyter extension (I believe the main Python extension includes it) to edit notebooks.
